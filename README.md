# Smart-Meter-Consumption

## Project Overview
This project aims to forecast electricity consumption using smart meter data. By comparing traditional regression approaches with time series models, we evaluate how different preprocessing strategies (like outlier removal, winsorization, and imputation) affect model performance on validation and test sets. The ultimate goal is to identify the most reliable and generalisable modelling pipeline for smart meter data forecasting.
